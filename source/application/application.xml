              it is illegal to return null, and doing so will result in exception.

              Since we can't get the values from the assembly, we use some heuristics to get it.

             The scope to be used for deserialization. 

            
              By default, the deserialization process uses a different scope than the rest of the application, which can lead to multiple proxies
              being generated for the same type. By explicitly setting the deserialization scope to the application's scope, this can be avoided.

             As   has no way of automatically determining the scope used by the application (and the application might use more than one scope at the same time),   uses a dedicated scope instance for deserializing proxy types. This instance can be reset and set to a specific value via   and   .

              The Null Logger class.  This is useful for implementations where you need
              to provide a logger to a utility class, but do not want any output from it.
              It also helps when you have a utility that does not have a logger to supply.

            The Stream Logger class.  This class can stream log information
            to any stream, it is suitable for storing a log file to disk,
            or to a MemoryStream
 for testing your components.

              The TraceLogger sends all logging to the System.Diagnostics.TraceSource
              built into the .net framework.
            

            
              Logging can be configured in the system.diagnostics configuration 
              section. 
            
              If logger doesn't find a source name with a full match it will
              use source names which match the namespace partially. For example you can
              configure from all castle components by adding a source name with the
              name "Castle". 
            
              If no portion of the namespace matches the source named "Default" will
              be used.
            

        

        
            
            Build a new trace logger based on the named TraceSource
            

            The name used to locate the best TraceSource. In most cases comes from the using type's fullname.

              This is an abstract   implementation
              that deals with methods that can be abstracted away
              from underlying implementations.

              Base class for facilities.
            

        

        
            
              Unit of extension. A facility should use 
              the extension points offered by the kernel
              to augment its functionality.
            

        

        
            
            

            

            

        

        
            
            

        

        
            
              The custom initialization for the Facility.
            

            
              It must be overridden.
            

        

        
            
              Performs the tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting 
              the facility resources.
            

            
              It can be overriden.
            

        

        
            
              Initializes the facility. First it performs the initialization common for all 
              facilities, setting the   and the 
               . After it, the Init
 method is invoked
              and the custom initilization is perfomed.
            

            

            

        

        
            
              Terminates the Facility, invokes the   method and sets 
              the Kernel to a null reference.
            

        

        
            
              Gets the facility configuration.
            

            The   representing 
              the facility configuration.

        

        
            
              Gets the   where the facility is registered.

                This method changes behavior of the facility. Deferred mode should be used when you have single call to   and register all your components there. Enabling
                this mode will optimize the behavior of the facility so that it will wait 'till the end of installation and only after all  s were ran it will instantiate and
                start all the startable components. An exception will be thrown if a startable component can't be instantiated and started. This will help you fail fast and diagnose issues quickly. If you don't
                want the exception to be thrown and you prefer the component to fail silently, use   method instead.
            

            It is recommended to use this method over   method.

        

        
            
                Startable components will be started when   method is invoked. This is particularily usedul when you need to perform some extra initialization outside of container
                before starting the Startable components.

            Attempts to dynamically load a UserControl by invoking Page.LoadControl. There are two uses of this class.
                 1) Add a component to the Kernel and add a VirtualPath attribute specifying the relative path of the .ascx file for the associated UserControl. (easy) 

                
                    
                  &lt;component id="BasketView" 
                  service="Castle.ShoppingCart.IBasketView, Castle.ShoppingCart"
                  type="Castle.ShoppingCart.BasketView, Castle.ShoppingCart" 
                  lifestyle="transient"
                  virtualPath="~/Views/BasketView.ascx"
                  /&gt;
                

                

                 2) Precompile a UserControl and add the pre-compiled class to the Kernel. (hard) Has not been tested with proxies. 

            

        

        
            
            	Standard implementation of  . Handles the selection of the best constructor, fills the writable properties the component exposes, run the commission and
            	decommission lifecycles, etc.
            

            
            	Custom implementors can just override the CreateInstance
 method. Please note however that the activator is responsible for the proxy creation when needed.
            

        

        
            
            Abstract implementation of  . The implementors must only override the InternalCreate and InternalDestroy methods in order to perform their creation and destruction
            logic.
            

        

        
            
              Implements the instance creation logic. The default
              implementation should rely on an ordinary call to 
              Activator.CreateInstance().
            

            
              This interface is provided in order to allow custom components
              to be created using a different logic, such as using a specific factory
              or builder.
              
                The constructor for implementation has the following signature:
              

              
                ComponentModel model, IKernel kernel, 
                ComponentInstanceDelegate onCreation, 
                ComponentInstanceDelegate onDestruction
              

              
                The Activator should raise the events onCreation and onDestruction
                in order to correctly implement the contract. Usually the best
                way of creating a custom activator is by extending the existing ones.

              and/or any resource related to it.

            Implemented by   which don't necessarily need dependencies from the container to activate new instances of the component.

              When a component is requested from a container and it was not registered, 
              container loads up all registered implementers of this interface and asks 
              them in turn whether they can provide that component, until it finds one that will.

            Registration that registers component for given key and/or service or null.

            
              While either key or service can be null reference it is guaranteed that at least one of them will not be null.
              When implementer opts in to provide the requested component (by returning not-null registration) it is required
              to register component for requested key/service combination (when one of the elements is null, it should be ignored as well).
              When implementer does not want to register the requested component it must return null.

 implements 
              a strategy for a given lifestyle, like singleton, per-thread

              The responsibility of ILifestyleManager

              is only the management of lifestyle. It should rely on

              Implementors should release the component instance based
              on the lifestyle semantic, for example, singleton components
              should not be released on a call for release, instead they should
              release them when disposed is invoked.
            

            

        

        
            
              Implementors should return the component instance based on the lifestyle semantic.
              Also the instance should be set to  ,   should be also set if needed

              Invoked when the container gets disposed. The container will not call it multiple times in multithreaded environments.
              However it may be called at the same time when some out of band release mechanism is in progress. Resolving those potential
              issues is the task of implementors

              Implementors should also ensure proper initialization of   when accessed for the first time and ensure a thread safe implementation is used when scope or cache access can cause threading issues if non thread safe cache is used.

            The interface gives no thread safety guarantees. When the scope can be accessed from multiple threads the implementor should ensure thread safety.

              The scope is passed on to child threads, including ThreadPool threads. The capability is limited to single   and should be used cautiously as call to   may occur while the child thread is still executing, what in turn may lead to subtle threading bugs.

 the   will use a cached shared with other resolvers of the same type.
            Sharing the cache will significantly improve performance with multiple resolver instances because expensive reflection will only
            happen once. This setting can cause unexpected behavior if different instances of the resolver are suppose to produce different
            results. When set to false it is highly recommended to reuse   instances with the  .

            The Assert class contains a collection of static methods that
            implement the most common assertions used in NUnit.
            

        

        
            
            We don't actually want any instances of this object, but some people
            like to inherit from it to add other static methods. Hence, the
            protected constructor disallows any instances of this object. 
            

        

        
            
            The Equals method throws an AssertionException. This is done 
            to make sure there is no mistake by calling this function.
            

            

            

        

        
            
            override the default ReferenceEquals to throw an AssertionException. This 
            implementation makes sure there is no mistake in calling this function 
            as part of Assert.

            The ITestCaseData interface is implemented by a class
            that is able to return complete testcases for use by
            a parameterized test method.
            
            NOTE: This interface is used in both the framework
            and the core, even though that results in two different
            types. However, sharing the source code guarantees that
            the various implementations will be compatible and that
            the core is able to reflect successfully over the
            framework implementations of ITestCaseData.

            The TestCaseData class represents a set of arguments
            and other parameter info to be used for a parameterized

            MessageWriter is the abstract base for classes that write
            constraint descriptions and messages in some form. The
            class has separate methods for writing various components
            of a message, allowing implementations to tailor the
            presentation as needed.

            Marks a test to use a combinatorial join of any argument data 
            provided. NUnit will create a test case for every combination of 
            the arguments provided. This can result in a large number of test
            cases and so should be used judiciously. This is the default join
            type, so the attribute need not be used except as documentation.

            Constructor for use by derived classes that use the
            name of the type as the property name. Derived classes
            must ensure that the Type of the property value is
            a standard type supported by the BCL. Any custom
            types will cause a serialization Exception when
            in the client.

            Marks a test to use pairwise join of any argument data provided. 
            NUnit will attempt too excercise every pair of argument values at 
            least once, using as small a number of test cases as it can. With
            only two arguments, this is the same as a combinatorial join.

            Marks a test to use a sequential join of any argument data
            provided. NUnit will use arguements for each parameter in
            sequence, generating test cases up to the largest number
            of argument values provided and using null for any arguments
            for which it runs out of values. Normally, this should be
            used with the same number of arguments for each parameter.

            Attribute used in a TestFixture to identify a method that is 
            called immediately after each test is run. It is also used
            in a SetUpFixture to identify the method that is called once,
            after all subordinate tests have run. In either case, the method 
            is guaranteed to be called, even if an exception is thrown.

            Attribute used to identify a method that is called after
            all the tests in a fixture have run. The method is

            Adding this attribute to a method within a   
            class makes the method callable from the NUnit test runner. There is a property 
            called Description which is optional which you can provide a more detailed test
            description. This class cannot be inherited.

            Ulp stands for "unit in the last place" and describes the minimum
            amount a given value can change. For any integers, an ulp is 1 whole
            digit. For floating point values, the accuracy of which is better
            for smaller numbers and worse for larger numbers, an ulp depends
            on the size of the number. Using ulps for comparison of floating
            point results instead of fixed tolerances is safer because it will
            automatically compensate for the added inaccuracy of larger numbers.

            Helper routines for working with floating point numbers

            
              
                The floating point comparison code is based on this excellent article:
                http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm
              

              
                "ULP" means Unit in the Last Place and in the context of this library refers to
                the distance between two adjacent floating point numbers. IEEE floating point
                numbers can only represent a finite subset of natural numbers, with greater
                accuracy for smaller numbers and lower accuracy for very large numbers.
              

              
                If a comparison is allowed "2 ulps" of deviation, that means the values are
                allowed to deviate by up to 2 adjacent floating point values, which might be
                as low as 0.0000001 for small numbers or as high as 10.0 for large numbers.
              

            

        

        
            Compares two floating point values for equality

            First floating point value to be compared

            Second floating point value t be compared

            
              Maximum number of representable floating point values that are allowed to
              be between the left and the right floating point values
            

            True if both numbers are equal or close to being equal

            
              
                Floating point values can only represent a finite subset of natural numbers.
                For example, the values 2.00000000 and 2.00000024 can be stored in a float,
                but nothing inbetween them.
              

              
                This comparison will count how many possible floating point values are between
                the left and the right number. If the number of possible values between both
                numbers is less than or equal to maxUlps, then the numbers are considered as
                being equal.
              

              
                Implementation partially follows the code outlined here:

            Compares two double precision floating point values for equality

            First double precision floating point value to be compared

            Second double precision floating point value t be compared

            
              Maximum number of representable double precision floating point values that are
              allowed to be between the left and the right double precision floating point values
            

            True if both numbers are equal or close to being equal

            
              
                Double precision floating point values can only represent a limited series of
                natural numbers. For example, the values 2.0000000000000000 and 2.0000000000000004
                can be stored in a double, but nothing inbetween them.
              

              
                This comparison will count how many possible double precision floating point
                values are between the left and the right number. If the number of possible
                values between both numbers is less than or equal to maxUlps, then the numbers
                are considered as being equal.

            Gets the list of external comparers to be used to
            test for equality. They are applied to members of
            collections, in place of NUnit's own logic.
            

        

        
            
            Gets the list of failure points for the last Match performed.
            The list consists of objects to be interpreted by the caller.
            This generally means that the caller may only make use of
            objects it has placed on the list at a particular depthy.
            

        

        
            
            RecursionDetector detects when a comparison
            between two enumerables has reached a point
            where the same objects that were previously
            compared are again being compared. This allows
            the caller to stop the comparison if desired.

            The Tolerance class generalizes the notion of a tolerance
            within which an equality test succeeds. Normally, it is
            used with numeric types, but it can be used with any
            type that supports taking a difference between two 
            objects and comparing that difference to a value.

            Tests that the current Tolerance is linear with a 
            numeric value, throwing an exception if it is not.
            

        

        
            
            Returns an empty Tolerance object, equivalent to
            specifying no tolerance. In most cases, it results
            in an exact match but for floats and doubles a
            default tolerance may be used.

            Returns a new tolerance with a TimeSpan as the amount, using 
            the current amount as a number of clock ticks.
            

        

        
            
            Returns true if the current tolerance is empty.

            The tolerance was created with a value, without specifying 
            how the value would be used. This is used to prevent setting
            the mode more than once and is generally changed to Linear
            upon execution of the test.

A sample Cookie header is shown below. In this example, there are two   with names state1 and state2 respectively. Further, each cookie state contains two name/value pairs (name1/value1 and name2/value2) and (name3/value3 and name4/value4). &lt;code&gt; Set-Cookie: state1:name1=value1&amp;amp;name2=value2; state2:name3=value3&amp;amp;name4=value4; domain=domain1; path=path1; &lt;/code&gt;

 *  - if an error is thrown in the generator, it propagates through
