Add new projects here. 

Put solutions at this root directory, projects in their individual folders

Make sure all project outputs go to bin[\x64|\x86] rather than bin\debug, makes it easier to debug issues

Make sure all projects reference the Version\AssemblyInfo.[cs|vb] rather than its own

All Solutions in this directory will have NuGet restore automatically
