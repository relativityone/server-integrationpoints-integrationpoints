I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.&nbsp; I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.&nbsp; With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.&nbsp; One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.&nbsp; I may have met Savita once in passing.&nbsp; I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.&nbsp; Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.&nbsp; I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.&nbsp; I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.&nbsp; --Sally<BR>
