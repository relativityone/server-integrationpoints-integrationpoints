Subject:  Vanderbilt -  Fantastic Friday results

Vanderbilt Team -
We had a very successful and fun Fantastic Friday this weekend with our Vanderbilt candidates.  We invited 10 of them here for final round interviews.  All of them accepted the invitation and came this weekend.  Out of 10, 6 will receive offers and 4 will receive declines.  The offer letters will go out today for overnight delivery.  Candidates have until 1-14-02 to reply to the offer.

Recruiting is not over yet!  Now its cultivation time!!  I am going to assign cultivation teams consisting of one senior person and two analysts to be in contact with candidates weekly.  The analysts on the team are responsible for sending me a weekly email updating me on the candidate's status, including any issues that may have come up.  If you do not have an assignment but want to help with this effort, please go ahead.  The more contact these candidates have with us the better!  Of course, if you have any questions that you cannot answer, please contact me.

Thank you all for your help to this point, now its time to close the deal!!
Beth
