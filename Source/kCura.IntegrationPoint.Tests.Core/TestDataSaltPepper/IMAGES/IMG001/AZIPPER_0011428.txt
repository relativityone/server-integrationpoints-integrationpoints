Hi,
Just thought I'd say hello to you at work. Getting ready to go pick up
Phoebe now, we will have some mama and phoebe quality time. she made it
to school five days this week! it can be done. they came and adjusted
the sprinkler head so the bushes get more water, hope that works.
looking forward to going out tonight.
love you, kmd
