Karen,
I worked in ENA West Risk from July 2000 until March 1, 2001, when I began West Logistics. Risk was counted as my first
rotation. Scheduling is my second.

All,

Thank you all for supplying details on your Trading Track rotation earlier.  I would however like for you to provide me with details of your previous rotations within the A&A program at Enron in the following format:

1.	Rotation (i.e. S/E Fundamentals)
2.	Business Unit (ENA/EGM etc)
3.	Duration (Month/year)
4.	Supervisor

I would be greatful if you could provide this as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

Karen.
