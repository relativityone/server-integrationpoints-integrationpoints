Thanks for the update. You're certainly hitting the pavement!<BR>
<BR>
Let's get together regarding Koch and Tauber's confidentiality concerns. I think we should be able to give them some comfort in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Please advise Koch that they do not need to &quot;make markets&quot; on EnronOnline. Our proposal gives them the right, but not the obligation, to post prices and volumes on the bid and/or offer side of the products they choose within the list we agree on.<BR>

This is to update you on a few meetings I have had and update you on my activities.<BR>
<BR>
Last week I met with:<BR>
Neste Petroelum - Their US Activities are not very applicable, but they are the Finnish National Oil Company and the trader I met with felt there may be some application with their physical European business.&nbsp; They are a big producer of &quot;clean&quot; gasoline and diesel that goes into the EU.&nbsp; He is going to supply an appropriate contact.<BR>
<BR>
Martin Resources - This is a medium size private company and the result of this meeting beyond general market intelligence was a possible interest in showing one market for sulfuric acid, which is a market where they have a Gulf Coast franchise.&nbsp; My contact who is one of the owners and he will revert after having interanl discussions<BR>
<BR>
Enterprise - This meeting got postpones until this coming Friday due to a crisis they had.&nbsp; I did spend a little time with Monty Wells (I think that was his names)&nbsp; who is the SVP incharge of the NGL's.&nbsp; I only presented the idea briefly for him tho think about.&nbsp; My meeting on Friday is with Jim Teague, President &amp; CEO of Enterprise NGL division.<BR>
<BR>
Tauber - Tauber is a medium sized trading company with $1 Billion in Revenues.&nbsp; they are active in Petrochemicals, NGL, Refined Products, and heavy oils.&nbsp; There was an interest and Tauber is an active EOL user and fan.&nbsp; My contact Scott Posednik runs the Petrochemical book and his biggest deal breaker was the security of the transaction information.&nbsp; He indicated the 1% chance that one of the EOL people with access to their data could share that with the commercial groups is a concern.&nbsp; He is going to discuss this with his colleagues and come back to us with their interest.&nbsp; They do a lot of trading in physical Raffinates, Naphtha, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Koch Hydrocarbons - This meeting was well timed as they are actively looking at their e-commerce startegy.&nbsp; I met with Mark Dobbins SVP -Trading and Ron Baker who runs their Olephins and NGL books.&nbsp; Their biggest hurdle is going to be getting comfortable making markets.&nbsp; Another issue will how the credit matrix works.&nbsp; It appears if they did something that they might need something a little more sophistacated than the basic offering.&nbsp; One final issue will be the reps and warranties made by Enron contractually as to the sharing of information with our business groups and the security of the data.&nbsp; They have apparently had an ordeal negotiating their master agreements to transact on EnronOnline and are warry of Enron's contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are going to have some internal discussions and revert next week.<BR>
<BR>
Shell Us Trading (SUSCO) - I had a very good conversation with Steven Murray and he was supposed to get back with me early this week about setting up a meeting.&nbsp; The boundries have been established that our interest would be in their making markets for Oil, Petrochemicals, NGLs and Chemicals only.&nbsp; Gas and Power are currently out of bounds.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
This week<BR>
I am Vancouver today and tommorrow attending a Wood products conference and I will be in Las Vegas on Thursday.&nbsp; After thoroughly reviewing the pulp and paper industry I think that the only sectors that would easily fit into this model will be the waste paper and lumber. I have had and will have discussion with other producers, but they are still hung up on branding and their products not being commodities ect.&nbsp; I am Vancouver and have several meetings together with the Rob Scheuer with lumber producers about showing offers.&nbsp; In Las Vegas, there is a conference where Ray Bowen is the keynote speaker and there are several potential counterparties attending , including Waste Management.&nbsp; My intent is not to spend too much time on Pulp and Paper and these two trips will allow me to quickly determine who the possible prospects are.<BR>
