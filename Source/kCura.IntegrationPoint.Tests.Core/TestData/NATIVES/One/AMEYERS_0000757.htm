<P><FONT SIZE=2>PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS<BR>
<BR>
On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).&nbsp; All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,&nbsp; involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.<BR>
<BR>
As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).&nbsp; Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.<BR>
<BR>
On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.&nbsp;<BR>
