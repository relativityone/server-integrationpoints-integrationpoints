| | ... | 2. ${ExistingAndUpdatedObject} exists in the Target RDO, but has updated details in the Source
| | ... | 3. ${ExistingNoChangeObject} exists in the Target RDO and has the same details as the Source
| | ... | 4. The ${RIPAppendOverlay1} RIP is set to Append/Overlay
| | ... |
| | ... | Steps:
| | ... | 1. Import Integration Point ${RIPAppendOverlay1} 
| | ... | 2. Go to the Target RDO's tab
| | ... | 3. Search for ${NewObject}
| | ... |
| | ... | Expected Results:
| | ... | 1. Verify that the object ${NewObject} is present

| | ... | 1. Verify that there is an Update entry for the object ${ExistingAndUpdatedObject}

| An Append and Overlay import does not update existing unmodified records
| | [Documentation] | Verify that when an Append and Overlay RIP is run with an existing record in the Target RDO with identical details in the Source, that it does not update the existing record in the Target RDO.
