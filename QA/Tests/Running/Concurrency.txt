| Importing the same Object Type from two different Sources
| | [Documentation] | [id] 13316c30-a89f-11e4-b34b-b8ca3a83048f
| | [Tags]			| manual	| integration_points
| | Run the following manual steps:
| | ... | Preconditions:
| | ... | 1. ${IntegrationPoint1} uses ${Source1} to import ${ObjectType1}
| | ... | 2. ${IntegrationPoint1} has [X] Objects to import
| | ... | 3. ${IntegrationPoint2} uses ${Source2} to import ${ObjectType1}
| | ... | 4. ${IntegrationPoint2} has [Y] Objects to import
| | ... | 5. [X] and [Y] are both at least one, and are not the exact same Object (they have different UniqueID values)
| | ... | 
| | ... | Steps:
| | ... | 1. Set both ${IntegrationPoint1} and ${IntegrationPoint2} to import five minutes from now
| | ... | 2. Wait until the Jobs finish
| | ... | 
| | ... | Expected Results:
| | ... | 1. Verify that the ${IntegrationPoint1} imported all [X] Objects correctly
| | ... | 2. Verify that the ${IntegrationPoint2} imported all [Y] Objects correctly
